# **About Me**
Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>
I was born on February 25, 1996 in Bologna :it:<br>

<!--
One day my parents brought a computer home... I was interested in that box from the first moment.<br>
With that computer my passion for video games also arrived.<br> 


<br>
In 2013, I started to be interested in programming and I developed my first game with [Construct2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2).<br>
<br>
At the beginning of 2014, I released [Space Squids](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bolopix.calamarispaziali), a game that I continue to update even today.<br>
<br>
In 2015, I started working with Ivan Venturi of [IV Productions](https://www.ivproductions.it).<br>
<br>
In January 2017, I, Ivan Venturi, Mirco Venturi, Luca Contato (Founder of [Rising Pixel](https://www.risingpixel.com)) and Stefano Enea Cabra founded "Associazione Audiogames" in order to produce and release audiogames. Expecially to produce the last chapter of the Eymerich saga: "Eymerich - The Demon".<br>
